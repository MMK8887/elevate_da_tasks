# Sales Data Analysis

## Key Findings
- The `sales_data.db` database was successfully created and populated with sample sales data including **product**, **quantity**, and **price**.
- A SQL query was executed to calculate the **total quantity sold** and **total revenue** for each product.
- The results of the SQL query were successfully loaded into a pandas DataFrame named `df_sales` with columns:
  - `product`
  - `total_quantity`
  - `total_revenue`
- The DataFrame `df_sales` output showed:
  - **Laptop**: 12 quantity, $14,400.0 revenue
  - **Keyboard**: 60 quantity, $4,500.0 revenue
  - **Mouse**: 120 quantity, $3,000.0 revenue
  - **Monitor**: 5 quantity, $1,500.0 revenue
- A bar chart visualizing the **total revenue per product** was generated, showing revenue distribution across products.
